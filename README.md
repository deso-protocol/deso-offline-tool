# DeSo Standalone App

## Online

TODO: add link to the live site.

### Offline

There are a few different ways to download the web app:

- Download it directly from the live online site by clicking the download button in the main menu.
- Visit the online page, and then in your system menu, click `File` -> `Save Page As`
- Download a specific version from the releases tab on github. TODO: add link.

Once you have the files downloaded, you can run the app by opening `deso-offline-tool.html` in
a browser. The site doesn't require network access, so it can be used in a
completely air gapped or otherwise offline environment.

### Development

- Clone this repo
- Run `npm run start`
- Make changes in the `./src` directory
